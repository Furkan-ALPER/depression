## Overview
This project explores the relationship between students' academic performance (CGPA) and several lifestyle factors such as sleep duration, study hours, social media usage, physical activity, and stress levels.  

The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, includes 100,000 participants.  
The analysis was conducted in R using basic statistical methods, primarily multiple linear regression.  

## Purpose
The goal of this project is not to provide advanced or definitive conclusions, but rather to practice fundamental biostatistical techniques and demonstrate how lifestyle variables may be associated with academic outcomes.  

## Key Points
- Large dataset (100,000 participants) ensures reliable patterns.  
- Focus on **basic level analysis** suitable for learning and practice.  
- Results are presented in a reproducible HTML report.
